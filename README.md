Credit: This repo was cloned from [React-Content-Script](https://github.com/yosevu/react-content-script) - I've added quite a few more features including background scripts and state management.

# React TypeScript Chrome Extension Template

This repository provides a comprehensive template for building a Chrome Extension using React and TypeScript. It includes examples of how to inject a React app into an existing webpage, utilize state management with Zustand and context, and establish communication between background and content scripts.

The goal of this repository is to provide a fully-featured template that allows users to quickly get started and explore the capabilities of building a Chrome Extension with React and TypeScript. Feedback and contributions in the form of issues and pull requests are welcome.

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [crxjs](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin) to build the extension.

## Features added

- Background Scripts - React components can communicate with the background scripts and react to fetched data.
- State Management - Context and Zustand.
- Chokidar - Allows the files to be watched and for the transpiler to run on any changes
- Path Aliases - Allows use of `@components/App` instead of `"../../Components/App"`

Why Zustand? Its quick and easy to get up and running, strip it you dont want it.

Why Context? I am using this to receive background script messages and update that zustand stores with that data. This is what allows the components to be react. You could do this all with vanilla zustand but I wanted to keep the zustand hooks. I also wanted to keep the `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` logic out of the other components and just have them consume the stores / context.
