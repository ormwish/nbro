Re-Cognitive "(c)" N.B. - the future is here
=============================================

```AI-assistant
If you plan to deliver this tool as a Chrome browser extension, you'll need to set up a dedicated component to handle your extension's specific logic and conform to Chrome's standard extension structure.

## Revised Project Filestructure

```t
/project-root:
  /public:
    - index.html
  /styles:
    - styles.css
  /components:
    - ChromeExtension.js
    - NotebookOverlay.js
    - IndexedDBManager.js
    - DataProcessor.js
    - ContextManager.js
    - CustomizationManager.js
  /scripts:
    - main.js
  /extension:
    - manifest.json
    - background.js
    - content.js
```

> ***Here are the new additions:***

1. **`ChromeExtension` Component** (`ChromeExtension.js`): This component will handle any Chrome extension-specific properties, methods, and API interactions. This usage is somewhat flexible and will depend on what Chrome API features your extension requires.

2. **`Extension Manifest`** (`manifest.json`): This is the metadata of your extension, containing properties like the extension's name, version, permissions, browser action specifics, and scripts to run.

3. **`Background Script`** (`background.js`): This script, specified in the manifest, runs in the background and maintains the extension's lifecycle events.

4. **`Content Script`** (`content.js`): The content script manages the interactions between your extension and the webpage it operates on. It's responsible for injecting and managing your Notebook Overlay on the pages where it's active.

## Revised Development Plan

A browser extension components have been added to the development plan:

1. **ChromeExtension Component**: Start by coding the behaviors and properties specific to your Chrome extension. This might include interacting with Chrome's extension-specific APIs, such as those that manage extension lifecycle events, browser tabs, or extension storage.

2. **Extension Setup**: Next, compile your extension's `manifest.json`. This will include declaring your background and content scripts, setting your permissions, and more.

3. **Background Script**: This script typically handles events related to the extension's lifecycle, such as on installation or on update. It can also maintain data across the lifetime of your extension.

4. **Content Script**: This script executes each time your extension is activated on a webpage and will manage the injection and interaction of your Notebook Overlay within that page.

Remember, developing a Chrome Extension necessitates understanding and following Chrome's extension development guidelines, practicing safe data handling, and thoroughly testing to ensure compatibility and performance on all intended webpages.
